## Description

A vanilla JavaScript application to schedule daily activities at work

There's only a single page, where the user is presented with rows of hour long time blocks.
The Time blocks start from 09:00 and end at 17:00.

The user can enter an activity by inputting text into the text area.

After inputting the text they then have the option to click the adjacent save button, saving the event
to the local storage.

When the page is refreshed or reloaded the events for the current day will still be saved.

### User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

### What did I Learn

For this project I kept strictly to the user requirements. I wanted to add more functionality, which I may do so in the future.

I've learned an awful lot about using jQuery and Bootstrap.

Specifically I learned:

- how to manipulate elements using jQuery, whether that's selecting, appending or removing etc.
- Quickly style elements using bootstrap to rapidly build sites
